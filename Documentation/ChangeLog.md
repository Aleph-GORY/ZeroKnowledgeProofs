### Added
- [Guide](https://github.com/Aleph-GORY/ZeroKnowledgeProofs/issues/2)
  to run the Zero Knowledge Authentication server.
- [TechnicalNote](https://github.com/Aleph-GORY/ZeroKnowledgeProofs/issues/1)
  based on the paper [Towards a zk-SNARK compiler for Wolfram language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02935.pdf)
 
### Fixed
 
## [1.0.0] - 2024-02-18
